    <p class="para">An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.</p>
      <p class="para">  Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</p>
    <h1 class="heading">Position:<span class="position">absolute</span></h1>
    <p class="para">An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).</p>

       <p class="para"> However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.</p>
